# Data Breach Incident Response

This playbook provides step-by-step instructions for responding to a data breach incident.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/MenakaGodakanda/Security-Incident-Response-Playbooks/blob/main/playbooks/data_breach/playbook.md">Playbook for Data Breach</a>

## Sample Log Data

- A sample log file is created to simulate a data breach (`playbooks/data_breach/examples/sample_log.txt`).
- Double-check that `sample_log.txt` actually contains data relevant to Data Breach.
- Ensure it is correctly formatted for the script to detect.

## Run the Detection Script

- `detect_breach.py` is the script to detect data breaches.
- Ensure that the Python script has the necessary permissions to read from the log file (`sample_log.txt`) and write to `example_output.txt`.
- The `detect_breach.py` script creates the `example_output.txt` file, which contains alerts generated by the `detect_breach.py` script when it finds log entries indicating failed password attempts for invalid users.
- Navigate to the data breach playbook directory:
    ```
    cd playbooks/data_breach
    ```
- Run the provided scripts:
    ```
    python scripts/detect_breach.py
    ```
- The output should look like this:<br><br>

- Check the `playbooks/data_breach/examples/` directory and verify the `example_output.txt` is created.

## Run the Ansible Playbook
- The Ansible playbook is used to automate the response to a security incident.
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated and run the Ansible playbook using the following command:
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i automation/inventory automation/ansible_playbook.yml -K
    ```
- `-i automation/inventory`: This flag specifies the path to your inventory file. Adjust the path if your inventory file is located elsewhere.
- `-K`: This flag prompts for the sudo password interactively.
- The playbook installs and configures necessary services, and the output demonstrates the steps Ansible takes to complete these tasks.

- The output should look like this:<br><br>
