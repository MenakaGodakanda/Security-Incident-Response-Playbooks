### Script to Detect Data Breaches (`playbooks/data_breach/scripts/detect_breach.py`)
#### Import Statements
- `import re`: This imports the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python. Regular expressions are used for searching, matching, and manipulating strings based on specific patterns.
- `from utils import send_alert`: This imports the `send_alert` function from the `utils` module. This function is likely responsible for sending an alert when a security breach is detected in the logs.

#### Constants
- `LOG_FILE`: This constant defines the path to the log file (`sample_log.txt`) that contains the server logs to be analyzed.
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: This constant defines the path to the output file (`example_output.txt`) where the alerts will be written after detection.

#### Function: `detect_breach`
- `def detect_breach():`: This defines a function named `detect_breach` that will be used to detect security breaches in the log file.
- `with open(LOG_FILE, 'r') as file:`: This opens the log file in read mode. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
- `logs = file.readlines()`: This reads all the lines from the log file and stores them as a list of strings in the variable `logs`. Each string in the list corresponds to a single line in the log file.
  - `alerts = []`: This initializes an empty list called `alerts` to store any alerts that are generated.
  - `for log in logs:`: This starts a loop that iterates over each line (log entry) in the `logs` list.
  - `if re.search(r'Failed password for invalid user', log):`: This uses the `re.search` function to check if the current log entry contains the string "Failed password for invalid user". The `r` before the string indicates a raw string, which means backslashes are treated literally.
  - `alert = send_alert(log)`: If the regular expression search is successful (i.e., the log entry matches the pattern), the `send_alert` function is called with the log entry as its argument. This function likely processes the log entry and generates an alert.
  - `alerts.append(alert)`: The generated alert is appended to the `alerts` list.
    - `with open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'w') as file:`: This opens the output file in write mode. Again, the `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes.
    - `for alert in alerts:`: This starts a loop that iterates over each alert in the alerts list.
    - `file.write(f"{alert}\n")`: This writes each alert to the output file, followed by a newline character. The `f` before the string indicates an f-string, which allows embedding expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.

#### Main Block
- `if __name__ == "__main__":`: This checks if the script is being run as the main program. If it is, the code inside this block is executed.
- `detect_breach()`: This calls the `detect_breach` function to start the process of detecting breaches in the log file.

### Utility functions used by the script (`playbooks/data_breach/scripts/utils.py`)
#### Function: send_alert
- Function Definition:
  - `def send_alert(message):`
    - This line defines a function named `send_alert` that takes a single parameter called `message`.
- Creating an Alert Message:
  - `alert = f"ALERT: {message}"`
    - This line creates a formatted string that combines the word "ALERT:" with the content of the `message` parameter.
    - The `f` before the string indicates an f-string, which allows embedding expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.
    - For example, if `message` is `"Failed password attempt from 192.168.1.100"`, the `alert` variable will be assigned the value `"ALERT: Failed password attempt from 192.168.1.100"`.
- Printing the Alert:
  - `print(alert)`
    - This line prints the `alert` string to the console. This is useful for debugging or logging purposes, allowing you to see the alert message immediately in the terminal or log file.
- Returning the Alert:
  - `return alert`
    - This line returns the `alert` string. By returning the alert, this function can be used in other parts of the program to capture and possibly further process the alert message.

### Ansible Inventory File (`playbooks/data_breach/automation/Inventory`)
Ansible uses inventory files to define which machines to manage and how to connect to them. The inventory file can be in various formats (INI, YAML, or dynamic inventory scripts), but the INI format is commonly used for static inventories. This snippet is in the INI format.

#### `[servers]`
- This line defines a group of hosts named servers.
- Groups are a way to organize and categorize hosts for easier management and targeted execution of playbooks and tasks.
- You can have multiple groups in an inventory file, and a host can belong to multiple groups.

#### `localhost ansible_connection=local`
- This line defines a host entry under the `servers` group.
- `localhost`
  - `localhost` is the hostname or IP address of the machine.
  - `localhost` refers to the local machine where Ansible is being run. It's a special hostname recognized by most systems to refer to itself.
- `ansible_connection=local`
  - This is a variable that specifies the connection type to be used when connecting to the host.
  - `ansible_connection` is a connection variable in Ansible.
  - The value `local` means that Ansible should run tasks locally on the machine where Ansible is being executed, rather than connecting over SSH or another remote connection method.

**Putting It All Together**
- This inventory file snippet does the following:
- Defines a group named `servers`:
  - This is a logical grouping of hosts, which in this case contains only one host: `localhost`.
- Defines a host `localhost` under the `servers` group:
  - Specifies that this host should be managed using the local connection type (`ansible_connection=local`), meaning Ansible will execute tasks directly on the local machine rather than connecting to a remote host.

### Sample Log File (`playbooks/data_breach/examples/sample_log.txt`)
This `sample_log.txt` contains log entries corresponds to activities logged by the `sshd` (SSH Daemon) service on a server. These logs typically contain important information about attempts to connect to the server via SSH.

#### Components of Each Log Entry
1. Timestamp:
    - `Jan 1 00:00:00`: The date and time when the log entry was recorded.
    - Each log entry begins with a timestamp in the format `Month Day HH:MM:SS`. This helps in identifying when a particular event occurred.

2. Hostname:
    - server: The name of the server where the SSH service (`sshd`) is running.
    - This indicates the source of the log entry, which is useful when managing multiple servers.

3. Service Name and Process ID:
    - `sshd[12345], sshd[12346], sshd[12347]`:
      - `sshd`: The service responsible for handling SSH connections.
      - `[12345], [12346], [12347]`: The process ID (PID) of the sshd instance handling the specific connection attempt. Each PID is unique to the process handling that particular SSH connection.

4. Event Description:
    - The main message in each log entry describes what happened during the SSH connection attempt.
    - `Failed password for invalid user admin`: An attempt to log in as the user `admin` failed because the password was incorrect and the user does not exist.
    - `Accepted password for user1`: The user `user1` successfully logged in with the correct password.
    - `Failed password for invalid user root`: An attempt to log in as the user `root` failed because the password was incorrect and the user does not exist.

5. Source IP Address:
    - `from 192.168.1.100, from 192.168.1.101, from 192.168.1.102`:
      - The IP address from which the connection attempt was made. This information can be used to identify the origin of the connection.

6. Port Number:
    - `port 22`: The network port used for the SSH connection. Port 22 is the default port for SSH.
    - This confirms that the connection attempt was made via the standard SSH port.

7. Protocol Version:
    - `ssh2`: The version of the SSH protocol used in the connection attempt. SSH-2 is the more secure and commonly used version compared to SSH-1.

### Script to Mitigate DDoS Attacks (`playbooks/ddos_attack/scripts//mitigate_ddos.py`)
#### Import Statements
- Imports the `block_ip` function from the `utils` module. This function is used to block IP addresses identified as malicious.

#### Constants
- `LOG_FILE`: This constant defines the path to the log file (`sample_log.txt`) that contains records of IP addresses making requests to the server.
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: This constant defines the path to the output file (`example_output.txt`) where the blocked IP addresses will be written.

#### Function: `detect_ddos`
- The function `detect_ddos` is defined to handle the detection of potential DDoS attacks.
- `ip_counter` is a dictionary that will store the count of requests made by each IP address.
- Reading and processing the log file
  - The log file is opened in read mode.
  - `file.readlines()` reads all lines from the log file and stores them in the `logs` list.
- Counting requests from each IP address
  - The code iterates through each log entry in the `logs` list.
  - For each log entry, it extracts the IP address by splitting the log string and taking the first part (`log.split()[0]`).
  - It checks if the IP address is already in the `ip_counter` dictionary:
    - If not, it initializes the count for that IP address to 0.
    - It increments the count of requests for that IP address by 1.
- Identifying and blocking malicious IP addresses
  - `blocked_ips` is a list that will store the IP addresses that have been blocked.
  - The code iterates through the `ip_counter` dictionary, checking the count of requests for each IP address:
    - If the count exceeds the threshold (10 in this case), it calls the `block_ip` function to block the IP address.
    - The blocked IP address is added to the `blocked_ips` list.
- Writing the blocked IP addresses to the output file
  - The output file is opened in write mode.
  - The code iterates through the `blocked_ips` list and writes each blocked IP address to the output file, each on a new line.

#### Main Block
- This block checks if the script is being run as the main program.
- If so, it calls the `detect_ddos` function to start the DDoS detection and mitigation process.

### Utility functions used by the script (`playbooks/ddos_attack/scripts/utils.py`)
#### Function: block_ip
- Function Definition:
  - This line defines the function `block_ip` which takes a single parameter `ip`.
  - The parameter `ip` is expected to be a string representing an IP address that needs to be blocked.
- Creating a Block Message:
  - This line creates a message string using an f-string (formatted string literal).
  - The f-string constructs a message by embedding the value of the `ip` variable into the string `"BLOCKED IP: {ip}"`.
  - This results in a string like `"BLOCKED IP: 192.168.1.1"` if the `ip` parameter was `"192.168.1.1"`.
- Printing the Block Message:
  - This line prints the constructed message to the console.
  - It serves as a way to log or indicate that an IP address has been blocked.
- Returning the Block Message:
  - This line returns the constructed message string from the function.
  - The returned message can be used by the caller of the function for further processing or logging.

**Putting It All Together**
The `block_ip` function simulates the process of blocking an IP address by:
- Creating a message indicating that the IP address has been blocked.
- Printing the message to the console for logging purposes.
- Returning the message for potential use by other parts of the program.
